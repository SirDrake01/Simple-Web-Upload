My channel name was "CALON KONSULTAN", but because there was the same name, my channel name changed to "EasyToSap".  My initial goal in creating this channel was to share knowledge about SAP [System Application and Product in Data Processing].  But because of my hobbies and work, I developed this channel with 3 concepts.  1. SirDrake01 Gaming 2. SAP Education with SAP Tutor Player 3. EasyToSap Tech  The first concept, since my hobby is playing games and trying new and old games, in this playlist I want to share with you how to play and anything about my hobbies.  The second concept, I have experience about SAP BW [Business Warehouse], in this playlist I want to share knowledge about how and what SAP is.  The third concept, I am a programmer and I like to learn various programming languages, in this playlist I want to share the source code for applications that I have made as well as open source applications [which I have bug fix and upgrade] to all my subscribers.  Sorry if my edited video is too boring since there are only intro and outro videos, because I am still a beginner in editing.  And hopefully in the future I can be even better.  For those who have subscribed, I thank you. With you subscribing to this channel, this channel will continue to grow.
